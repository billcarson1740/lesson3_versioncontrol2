</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a process of organization for dealing with multiple versions of the same and different file types.  General naming conventions isn’t always enough to keep track of everything.  Additionally, version control enables multiple users to work on the same file at the same time.  This is creates a better working environment for a team to accomplish their goal quicker and more efficiently.  Essentially, version control creates a repository or “library” of files and data.  Then users may come along and “check out” a file or data type.  Once the user has a copy of the requested file they may begin editing it on their own computer.  This entire process is efficient and solves the problem of complications that would arise from too many people having to share the same file.  Using a version control also enables a user to keep a thorough record of all changes made to a file, who made them, when they were made, and for what purpose.  This is ideal for any sort of troubleshooting or questions that might pop up in the final stages of any project, or even years later.  Overall, version control is ideal for extensive projects that require organization and multiple users.  However, version control isn’t just for multiple users, as the single user may require the same organizational tools and resources.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Using Version Control and Applications</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this highlight I would like to discuss the actual operation of version control and its applications in the real world.  As previously stated, version control creates a repository for users to download, or “Pull” from.  In order to make this possible the version control creates two repositories: One remote where multiple users may have access to the shared files, and one local repository on the user's machine.  This set of repositories enables the “Pulling” of files onto the local repository and the upload, or “Push” of files to the remote repository.  The process of having two repositories makes using version control more efficient when files must be merged back together.  Version control has no limit for who or how it should be used.  Any author of a file may with to use the tools and resources that version control offers.  Real world examples of users might be: designers, developers, or programmers.  Agin, teams can be more productive and ideal for version control but single users may also find value in backing their files to a remote repository.  A great example for a real world project that would find version control useful would be the construction of a website.  Multiple file types are required and the project could require that a team with different skill sets work together editing the same file at the same time.

                <span class="text-muted">Using Git for Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was introduced in this lesson in order to create a link to our clould9 virtual machine.  This process involved having both accounts acknowledge the other and requests be sent between them.  A local repository was created on my virtual machine and then synced to the remote repository on Git.  This will enable me to push and pull files between the two repositories.  The representative from Git described this version control as the best out there.  Git is used by well known companies including: Google, Facebook, Netflix, and more.  This type of introduction to version control could be very useful to students who require understanding and skills that real world companies need.  Git claims to be faster and more efficient than any other version control.  Git also claims to be user friendly to beginners.  With that being said, the representative from Git then went on to say that it’s not just for beginners either, as advanced users may also find more complex tools available to meet their needs.  After my own experience with git, I would say that it’s a bit confusing to start and initially create a local repository on cloud9.  However, once it was all set up the Git’s interface doesn’t seem too complex and looks friendly.  This seems very applicable to the material that we are learning and I’m very glad to be exposed to it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Version Control Process</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What is actually going on between our cloud9 machine and Git?  The uploading process can be described as follows:  
(1)  You start off with a created working directory
(2)  You may then initialize the repository with the git init command
(3)  You may then add a remote place which will be called orign
(4)  Once an origin is created you may “add” edited files to the staging area.
(5)  When you are ready, you may commit the changes made to the repository using git commit
(6)  Now you may use git push and finalize the process by “pushing” the files to the remote repository in Git Hub

Now that files have been “pushed” to the remote repository, they may now be pulled to a local repository using the command “git pull”.  This is not the only process for downloading, a user may wish to clone the remote repository and being editing from there.  Once another user has made any edits they may wish to contribute to a project by “pushing” their contribution in the same manner mentioned above.  Note that the repository will keep a backup of every edit or change.  In addition to backing up, git will keep a detailed log of all changes made and who can be “blamed” for what line. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This lesson went into several Git commands that were necessary for initial start up, and should prove useful in the future.  The lesson also introduced Git calisthenics which provided an opportunity to push our simple repository to Git and then edit and handle merge conflicts.  Merging is something important to consider while working with Git.  Things do not always merge perfectly and even though Git is designed to identify any conflict, it is still up to the user or master to make any final decisions to change.  If Git finds that there are multiple lines that are similar it will automatically merge them automatically.  However, this isn’t always what the master or user may intend so it’s important to be aware of any changes that Git may automatically make. Now that I have a clone of the remote repository on my own machine I am able to use these commands that I can use anytime.  The commands are as follows:
Git init (this will initialize Git)
Git add --all (this will get all files ready to commit)  
Git commit (this releases the added files to the remote repository)
Git log (this will show the commits)
Git status (this should show the current status)
Git pull (this requests that files be pulled from the repository)
Git push (this requests that the files be pushed to the repository)
